This was the day I finally took a real step to connect with you. I remember how my parents were hesitant to let me go to Nyah's house because 
I might get home late, but I managed to persuade them—and that decision led to something unforgettable. I cannot even imagine if I had stayed home instead; 
I would have missed a moment that meant so much. I am beyond grateful for that day, 
and I will never forget the way you gently rubbed and played with my hair. Honestly, I am still in awe that I got to experience that closeness with you.

Lauder bought the LEGO set specifically for the two of us to build, and even though you were shy at first, 
you eventually asked me to sit beside you instead of across from you. 
That simple invitation gave me the biggest wave of butterflies—sitting next to my crush felt unreal, 
like something I only ever daydreamed about. I was overflowing with joy in that moment (which you can totally see in the photo), 
and honestly, I wanted to reach for your hand so badly I could have burst.

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I still remember the day when you really loved giving me back hugs; I never expected you to be so physical. Going back to it makes me think na sobrang cute mo huhu. 
I wish I could go back to that time and turn around and hug you more.
 Oo nga palaaaaaa, nakuha ko yung number 11 sa jersey dahil sayo mewhehwehwe; it carries you, that moment, and everything it symbolizes. 
 These were also the days when you'd kiss the back of my neck and wrap me in those warm back hugs that I adored more than I ever managed to say out loud.
 That time, all I could think of is you and just you, no care for others even if PDA tayo HAHAHAHA I LOVE YOU!

                <p>This day might be the best and the most conflicting, but I am thankful that we managed to go through those problems. 
Looking back at this picture makes me sad, since these were almost the days when you would leave the country na so I am just making the time worth as much as I can. 
These day was the best because I get to be with you the whole day from sunrise to sunset, I was with you. 
But even if ganun we still made a problem—mostly me, because yk yeh, I am sorry but I love you so much. Thank you for staying through our ups and downs. 
I love you i love you i love you. I wil always be here no matter.</p>
